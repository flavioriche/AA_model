# AA_model
python script for calculating the AA model.
Basically, the AA model is a 1D tight binding model with a quasi-periodic on-site potential,
so that the lattice doesn´t have a unit cell. By controlling the on-site potential, it is possible
to reproduce disorder-like effects, measured by the inverse participation ratio (IPR).
The code´s output allows us to plot the IPR color map, as a function of the energy and the potential.
I shared this code for educational purposes.
Fell free to use and to improve this code!
